# @guest-sync:
#
# Echo back a unique integer value
#
# This is used by clients talking to the guest agent over the
# wire to ensure the stream is in sync and doesn't contain stale
# data from previous client. All guest agent responses should be
# ignored until the provided unique integer value is returned,
# and it is up to the client to handle stale whole or
# partially-delivered JSON text in such a way that this response
# can be obtained.
#
# Such clients should also precede this command
# with a 0xFF byte to make such the guest agent flushes any
# partially read JSON data from a previous session.
#
# @id: randomly generated 64-bit integer
#
# Returns: The unique integer id passed in by the client
#
# Since: 0.15.0

# @guest-suspend-disk
#
# Suspend guest to disk.
#
# This command tries to execute the scripts provided by the pm-utils package.

# writing to a sysfs file.
#
# For the best results it's strongly recommended to have the pm-utils
# package installed in the guest.
#
# Returns: nothing on success
#          If suspend to disk is not supported, Unsupported
#
# Notes: o This is an asynchronous request. There's no guarantee a response
#          will be sent
#        o It's strongly recommended to issue the guest-sync command before
#          sending commands when the guest resumes

##
# @guest-suspend-ram
#

#
# For the best results it's strongly recommended to have the pm-utils
# package installed in the guest.
#
# IMPORTANT: guest-suspend-ram requires QEMU to support the 'system_wakeup'
# command.  Thus, it's *required* to query QEMU for the presence of the
# 'system_wakeup' command before issuing guest-suspend-ram.
