<h1 class="title">Preparing an OS Image for S2E</h1>

<p>There are no specific requirements for the OS image to make it runnable in S2E.
Any x86 32-bit image that boots in vanilla QEMU will work in S2E. However, we enumarate a list of tips
and optimizations that will make administration easier and symbolic execution faster.
<em>These tips should be used as guidelines, and are not mandatory.</em></p>
<p>Here is a checklist we recommend to follow:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Install your operating system in the vanilla QEMU. It is the fastest approach. In general, all installation and setup tasks should be done in vanilla QEMU.</li>
<li>Always keep a <em>RAW</em> image file of your setup. QEMU tends to corrupt <em>QCOW2</em> images over time. You can easily convert a RAW image into <em>QCOW2</em> using the <em>qemu-img</em> tool. Corruptions manifest by weired crashes that did not use to happen before.</li>
<li>Keep a fresh copy of your OS installation. It is recommended to start with a fresh copy for each analysis task. For instance, if you use an image to test a device driver, avoid using this same image to analyze some spreadsheet component. One image = one analysis. It is easier to manage and your results will be easier to reproduce.</li>
<li>Once your (QCOW2) image is setup and ready to be run in symbolic execution mode, take a snapshot and resume that snapshot in the S2E-enabled QEMU. This step is not necessary, but it greatly shortens boot times. Booting an image in S2E can take a (very) long time.</li>
<li>It is recommended to use 128MiB of RAM for the guest OS (or less). S2E is not limited by the amount of memory in any way (it is 64-bit),  but your physical machine is.</li>
</ul>
<p>The following checklist is specific to Windows guests. All common tips also apply here.</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li>Disable fancy desktop themes. Windows has a GUI, which consumes resources. Disabling all visual effects will make program analysis faster.</li>
<li>Disable the screen saver.</li>
<li>Disable unnecessary services to save memory and speedup the guest. Services like file sharing, printing, wireless network configuration, or firewall are useless unless you want to test them in S2E.</li>
</ul>
